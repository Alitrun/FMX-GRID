This component has been developed and maintained primarily by me over several years in a private company repository. 

In early 2024, a new public Git repository was launched to facilitate its sharing and ensure ongoing updates.

https://github.com/a-dato/FMX-GRID  

In that new Git repository, my commits were made using the names "Alex" and "AlexAlit."
